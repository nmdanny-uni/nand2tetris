Remarks & Implementation notes
-------
Most of the functionality was implemented as described in the book/videos.
See comments in files for explanation about trickier parts(e.g bitwise
operations, segment structure) and optimizations.

Some notable optimizations included:
- Math.jack: Division doesn't use multiplication
- Screen.jack: Drawing horizontal lines is done in chunks except for the
  beginning/end, drawPixel doesn't use multiplication
