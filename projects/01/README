(No helper chips were needed)

Remarks
-------
* The normal variants use the minimal number of NAND gates as described in the moodle. I don't know
  how many are required for multi-bit/multi-way gates, so I don't know if my impls are ptimal,
  but I tried to re-use previous gates as much as possible.
* Some of the trickier chips have explanation in the README on the intuition behind them
